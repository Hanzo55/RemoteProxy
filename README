RemoteProxy

This is a simple CF wrapper for webservice calls. It will provide you with some better availability, caching data as it's requested, which can be used if the service ever goes offline.

This version only supports calls that return queries, but adding support for other types should be trivial.

USAGE:

Take your existing webservice calls:

<cfset wsService = CreateObject('webservice','http://www.myservice.com/') />

And compose them into the proxy instead:

<cfset wsService = CreateObject('component','remoteProxy') />
<cfset wsService.setEndpoint('http://www.myservice.com/') />

Now, the rest of your code should remain the same. When your CF code calls a method on the webservice, the remoteProxy calls it instead, delegating to onMissingMethod(), where the magic happens.
